- First, I am going to create a hacky solution, then I am going to jump into the GUI program.

Hacky solution
--------------
- Formatting time input will be split by ":"
- Counting down process:
	- Find hours, minutes, seconds, using total time that was converted to seconds. 
            - Hours can be founded by using int(totalTimeSec / 3600) because there are 3600 seconds in an hour.
        	- Minutes can be founded by using int(totalTimeSec / 60) % 60. There are 60 seconds in a minute and the remainder of is total minutes
        	- Seconds is founded by dividing total time by 60.
        - Create a loop to control program sleep. Sleeping in this case means that the program will not run for one second.

- User can set another time after they are done.
- Might implement task managing. Simply a TODO list.
